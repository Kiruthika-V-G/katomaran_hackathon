# Autonomous Robot Navigation

Problem Statement 1: Grid-based Robot Navigation :-
                         This simulation aims to navigate a robot within a 10x10 grid from a specified source point to a destination point while avoiding randomly generated obstacles. It includes various components 
such as grid environment setup, user input handling, path planning with obstacle avoidance, validation and testing, and output visualization.

Problem Statement 2: Autonomous Navigation Algorithm for Robot :-   
                        This task involves designing an autonomous navigation algorithm for a robot to navigate from a known starting position to the center point of a rectangular pillar defined by its four corners.
The robot must avoid diagonal movements and pillar collisions, minimizing total distance traveled.
